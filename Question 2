Question 2: Index Strategy & Query Optimization Thinking
Scenario:
The following query is frequently used by end users:
SELECT *
FROM HastaKayit
WHERE LOWER(AdSoyad) LIKE '%ahmet%' AND YEAR(KayitTarihi) = 2024
Question:
1. What performance problems might arise from this query?
2. How would you optimize this query and/or the table structure?
3. Are there any improvements that could be made on the application side?
