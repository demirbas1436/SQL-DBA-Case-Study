Question 1: Performance & Scalability Analysis in Hospital Data
Scenario:
A table below has been used for 5 years in a Hospital Information Management System (HBYS). Each day, about
25,000 rows are inserted.
Recently, queries on this table have become slower and users have reported difficulty accessing past records.
CREATE TABLE HastaIslemLog (
 Id INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
 HastaId INT,
 IslemTarihi DATETIME,
 IslemKodu NVARCHAR(20),
 Aciklama NVARCHAR(500)
);
Question:
1. What could be the reasons for the performance degradation?
2. What improvements would you suggest for better sustainability?
3. Do you think using the table in this way for 5 years was the correct approach? Why or why not?
